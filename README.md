ECOP Protocol
=================

The ECOP Protocol is an Ethereum smart contract for supplying or borrowing assets. Through the cToken contracts, accounts on the blockchain *supply* capital (Ether or ERC-20 tokens) to receive cTokens or *borrow* assets from the protocol (holding other assets as collateral). The ECOP cToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates for borrowers.
