ESG Protocol
=================

The ESG Protocol is an Binance smart contract for supplying or borrowing assets. Through the eToken contracts, accounts on the blockchain *supply* capital (BNB or BEP-20 tokens) to receive eTokens or *borrow* assets from the protocol (holding other assets as collateral). The ESG eToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates for borrowers.
